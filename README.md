# PhyscPep
Codes of A novel therapeutic peptide prediction method using physicochemical property encoding and feature representation learning. 

In comparison to most established predicotrs, this method can perform both high quality generic prediction and informative physicochemical properties identification simultaneously.

Before running the code, make sure
1. Python 3.7 has been installed in your environment.
2. WEKA 3.8 has been installed in your environment. Mentioned that WEKA may need java VM, details about how to install WEKA can be found via https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html
3. Python-weka-wrapper3 has been added into your Python library. This needs additional Python dependencies as well as Oracle JDK for smooth running. Details can be found via https://github.com/fracpete/python-weka-wrapper3
4. Following common Python libraries have been installed:
   numpy, matplotlib,math,random,xlrd,xlwt,csv,pandas,os,scipy,sys,openpyxl,getopt.
   The above libraries can be installed using command: pip install NAME OF PACKAGE.
